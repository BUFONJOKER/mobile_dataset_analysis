# 📱 Mobile Dataset Analysis and Visualization

## 🧭 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize a mobile dataset to extract insights and build predictive models. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and deployment.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **🧹 Data Preprocessing**
    - Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates)
    - Feature engineering (creating new features, encoding categorical variables)
    - Data normalization and scaling

2. **🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Visualizing distributions of key features
    - Analyzing relationships between features
    - Identifying trends and patterns

3. **🤖 Model Building**
    - Selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms
    - Training models on the processed dataset
    - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance

4. **📊 Model Evaluation**
    - Assessing model performance using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
    - Comparing different models and selecting the best one

5. **🚀 Model Deployment**
    - Deploying the final model to a production environment
    - Setting up monitoring and maintenance processes
